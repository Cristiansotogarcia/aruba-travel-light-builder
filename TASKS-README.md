- **Components**: A list of the components that will need to be created or modified
- **Dependencies**: A list of tasks that must be completed before this task can be started

## Planned Improvements

### 1. Reporting and Analytics

Enhance the system with comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities to provide better business insights.

- **Booking Analytics Dashboard**: Create a dedicated dashboard showing booking trends, revenue metrics, and equipment utilization

### 2. Inventory Management

Improve inventory tracking and management capabilities to optimize equipment utilization.

- **Equipment Availability Calendar**: Create a visual calendar showing equipment availability and conflicts
- **Inventory Alerts**: Implement alerts for low inventory, maintenance needs, and booking conflicts
- **Equipment Maintenance Tracking**: Add functionality to track equipment maintenance history and schedule future maintenance

### 3. Customer Portal

Develop a customer-facing portal for self-service booking management.

- **Customer Account Creation**: Implement customer registration and account management
- **Booking Self-Service**: Allow customers to view, modify, and cancel their bookings
- **Booking History**: Provide customers with access to their booking history and receipts

### 4. Notification System

Implement a comprehensive notification system for users and customers.

- **Email Notifications**: Set up automated email notifications for booking confirmations, reminders, and updates
- **In-App Notifications**: Implement an in-app notification center for users
- **SMS Notifications**: Add SMS notification capabilities for delivery updates and reminders

### 5. Mobile Optimization

Enhance the mobile experience for all user roles.

- **Responsive Dashboard**: Optimize the admin dashboard for mobile devices
- **Driver Mobile Interface**: Create a dedicated mobile interface for drivers with optimized task views and maps
- **Offline Capabilities**: Implement limited offline functionality for critical operations

### 6. Recurring Booking Support

### Security Enhancements

- **Review Token Management and Session Handling**: Reviewed `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx` to ensure secure and efficient management of authentication tokens and user sessions. Confirmed that the current implementation aligns with Supabase best practices for client-side applications, with the Supabase client library managing JWT storage, refresh, and revocation on sign-out. No immediate changes were deemed necessary.

Improve the security of the application through enhanced authentication and authorization mechanisms.

- **Status:** In Progress (RLS policies defined)
- **Implement RLS Policies**: Defined and implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for `bookings`, `profiles`, and `booking_items` tables to enhance data access control. Policies consider different user roles (Booker, Driver, Admin, SuperUser) and operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). SQL script located at <mcfile path="c:\\Users\\Hype Consultancy\\aruba-travel-light-builder\\supabase\\migrations\\20240619123456_create_rls_policies.sql" name="20240619123456_create_rls_policies.sql"></mcfile>.
- [x] **Enhance Error Handling for RLS:** Improved error messages in components like <mcfile path="c:\Users\Hype Consultancy\aruba-travel-light-builder\src\components\admin\BookingsList.tsx" name="BookingsList.tsx"></mcfile> to provide clearer feedback to users when RLS policies restrict actions.
### Modify Login and Sign-Up Flow for Roles
- **Status:** Completed
- **Details:** Updated the user sign-up process in <mcfile name="useAuth.tsx" path="src/hooks/useAuth.tsx"></mcfile> to assign a default role of 'Booker' to new users upon registration. Added a sign-up link to the <mcfile name="Login.tsx" path="src/pages/Login.tsx"></mcfile> page.

### UI Adjustments for Roles and Permissions
- **Status:** Completed
- **Details:** Implemented UI adjustments based on user roles and permissions. This involved:
  - Conditionally rendering navigation links and CTAs in <mcfile name="Header.tsx" path="src/components/layout/Header.tsx"></mcfile> based on authentication status and user role (e.g., showing 'Logout' and role-specific dashboard links for logged-in users, adjusting 'Book Now' visibility).
  - Creating a <mcfile name="ProtectedRoute.tsx" path="src/components/layout/ProtectedRoute.tsx"></mcfile> component to handle route-level access control.
  - Integrating <mcfile name="ProtectedRoute.tsx" path="src/components/layout/ProtectedRoute.tsx"></mcfile> into <mcfile name="App.tsx" path="src/App.tsx"></mcfile> to protect routes like `/admin`, `/customer-dashboard`, and `/driver-dashboard`, redirecting unauthorized users.
  - Verified that <mcfile name="AdminSidebar.tsx" path="src/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx"></mcfile> already correctly uses the `hasPermission` hook to filter its navigation items.

Add support for recurring bookings and subscription-based rentals.

- **Recurring Booking Creation**: Implement the ability to create bookings that repeat on a schedule
- **Subscription Management**: Add functionality to manage long-term rental subscriptions
- **Recurring Booking Calendar**: Enhance the calendar view to properly display recurring bookings

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation of these improvements should follow these guidelines:

1. **Prioritize high-priority tasks**: Focus on tasks marked as high priority first
2. **Consider dependencies**: Ensure that dependent tasks are completed in the correct order
3. **Maintain consistency**: Follow the existing code style and architecture
4. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure that all new features are thoroughly tested
5. **Document changes**: Update documentation as new features are implemented

## Integration with Existing System

These improvements should be integrated with the existing system in a way that maintains compatibility with the current codebase. The existing components and data structures should be leveraged where possible, and new components should follow the same patterns and conventions.

The improvements should be implemented incrementally, with each task being completed and tested before moving on to the next. This will ensure that the system remains stable and functional throughout the implementation process.
