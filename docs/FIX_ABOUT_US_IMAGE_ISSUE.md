# Fix About Us Image Upload Issue

## Problem Description
When uploading images through Cloudflare in the About Us management section, users encounter a 406 (Not Acceptable) error:
```
GET https://abofxrgdxfzrhjbvhdkj.supabase.co/rest/v1/content_blocks?select=title%2Ccontent&block_key=eq.about_us_full&page_slug=eq.about-us 406 (Not Acceptable)
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the AboutUsManagement component trying to query a non-existent `content_images` table and using an incorrect data structure for storing images. The component was attempting to:

1. Query `content_images` table which doesn't exist
2. Use file paths instead of direct URLs like the equipment system
3. Missing database columns for storing image URLs

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
Created `supabase/migrations/20250715170900_fix_about_us_images.sql` which:
- Added `image_url` column to `content_blocks` table for direct image URL storage
- Added `metadata` JSONB column for storing additional image data
- Created appropriate indexes for performance
- Ensures data integrity

### 2. Updated Data Structure
Changed from using a separate `content_images` table to storing images directly in the `content_blocks` table, following the same pattern used in the equipment system:

**Before:**
```typescript
// Separate table approach (problematic)
const { data: image } = await supabase
  .from('content_images')
  .select('file_path, alt_text')
  .eq('image_key', 'about_us_image')
  .single();
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Direct URL storage (working)
const { data: content } = await supabase
  .from('content_blocks')
  .select('title, content, image_url, metadata')
  .eq('block_key', 'about_us_full')
  .eq('page_slug', 'about-us')
  .single();
```

### 3. Updated Component Logic
Modified `AboutUsManagement.tsx` to:
- Use `image_url` column for main images
- Use `metadata` JSONB for additional images
- Follow the same pattern as equipment images (direct URL storage)
- Fixed TypeScript interfaces

### 4. Updated Seed Scripts
Updated both seed scripts to include the new columns:
- `scripts/seed-about-us-content.ts`
- `scripts/seed-about-us-content.js`

## Files Modified

### Database Migrations
- `supabase/migrations/20250715170900_fix_about_us_images.sql` - New schema changes

### Component Updates
- `src/components/admin/AboutUsManagement.tsx` - Fixed image handling logic

### Seed Scripts
- `scripts/seed-about-us-content.ts` - Updated with new columns
- `scripts/seed-about-us-content.js` - Updated with new columns

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations
```bash
# Apply the new migration
npx supabase db push

# Or for remote database
npx supabase db push --linked
```

### Step 2: Seed Initial Data (if needed)
```bash
# Ensure environment variables are set
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Supabase credentials

# Run seed script
npx tsx scripts/seed-about-us-content.ts
```

### Step 3: Test Image Upload
1. Go to Admin dashboard â†’ About Us Management
2. Click "Upload Image" for either homepage or about page
3. Select an image through Cloudflare upload
4. Image should upload successfully and display immediately

## Technical Details

### Image Storage Pattern
Following the equipment system's pattern:
- **Direct URL storage**: Images are stored as full URLs in `image_url` column
- **Metadata support**: Additional images stored in JSONB `metadata` field
- **No file path conversion**: Eliminates complexity of file path to URL conversion

### Cloudflare Integration
- Uses existing `CloudflareImageUpload` component
- Images are uploaded to Cloudflare and URLs are stored directly
- No need for Supabase storage bucket management

### Error Resolution
The 406 error was resolved by:
1. Removing queries to non-existent `content_images` table
2. Using correct column names in queries
3. Following consistent data structure across the application
