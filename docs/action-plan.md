# Production Readiness Action Plan

This document outlines the steps to make the Aruba Travel Light Builder application production-ready.

1.  **Implement Global Error Handling:**
    *   Create a global React `ErrorBoundary` component to catch and gracefully handle unexpected JavaScript errors throughout the application, preventing crashes and providing a better user experience.
    *   Wrap the main application layout or router with this `ErrorBoundary`.

2.  **Standardize Loading State Management:**
    *   Review existing loading state implementations for consistency.
    *   Consider a more centralized or standardized approach if needed, perhaps using a global loading indicator for route transitions or a consistent pattern for component-level loaders.

3.  **Review and Enhance Authentication/Authorization:**
    *   Thoroughly review the authentication flow in `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx` and related components.
    *   Ensure secure token handling (e.g., HttpOnly cookies if applicable, secure storage).
    *   Implement robust route guards for all protected routes based on user roles and permissions.
    *   Verify session management, including expiration and renewal.

4.  **Implement Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for critical utility functions, hooks (especially `useAuth.tsx` and `useBooking.ts`), and complex UI components. Aim for good coverage of business logic.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Test key user flows, such as the booking process, login/logout, and dashboard interactions, to ensure different parts of the application work together correctly.
    *   **(Optional) End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** For overall application stability, consider E2E tests using tools like Cypress or Playwright to simulate real user scenarios across the entire application.

5.  **Ensure UI/UX Consistency and Accessibility:**
    *   Conduct a full review of all UI components to ensure a consistent design language (styling, spacing, typography) across the application.
    *   Verify that all interactive elements are accessible: proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigability, sufficient color contrast, and screen reader compatibility.

6.  **Optimize Application Performance:**
    *   **Code Splitting/Lazy Loading:** Implement route-based code splitting and lazy load components/pages that are not immediately needed to reduce initial bundle size and improve load times.
    *   **Memoization:** Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` where appropriate to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components and expensive calculations.
    *   **Image Optimization:** Ensure images are appropriately sized and compressed.
    *   Analyze bundle size using tools like `vite-bundle-visualizer`.

7.  **Set Up Production Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   Integrate a client-side error tracking service (e.g., Sentry, Bugsnag) to capture and report errors occurring in the production environment.
    *   Implement structured logging for key application events on the client-side, which can be sent to a logging service if needed.
    *   If there's a backend component (even if serverless via Supabase), ensure appropriate logging is in place there as well.
