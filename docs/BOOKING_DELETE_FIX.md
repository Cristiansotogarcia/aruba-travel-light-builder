# Booking Deletion Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. Foreign Key Constraint Violation on booking_audit_log
**Error Code:** 23503
**Error Message:** `insert or update on table "booking_audit_log" violates foreign key constraint "booking_audit_log_booking_id_fkey"`

**Root Cause:** 
The AFTER DELETE trigger on the `bookings` table was attempting to insert an audit log entry after the booking was being deleted. This caused a foreign key violation because the trigger tried to reference a booking ID that was in the process of being deleted.

**Solution:**
- Created migration `20250131000005_fix_cascade_delete_audit_log.sql`
- Modified the `create_booking_audit_log()` function to skip DELETE operations
- Updated the trigger to only fire on INSERT and UPDATE operations
- Since audit logs have `ON DELETE CASCADE`, they are automatically deleted when the parent booking is deleted

### 2. Invalid Relationship Query Error
**Error Code:** PGRST200
**Error Message:** `Could not find a relationship between 'booking_items' and 'equipment' in the schema cache`

**Root Cause:**
In `BookingsList.tsx`, the query attempted to join `booking_items` with `equipment` table using nested selection syntax, but this relationship wasn't properly defined in the database schema.

**Solution:**
- Modified the query in `BookingsList.tsx` to only select the fields already present in `booking_items`
- Removed the invalid nested join: `booking_items(*, equipment(*))`
- Replaced with explicit field selection: `booking_items(equipment_name, quantity, equipment_price, subtotal, equipment_id)`

### 3. TypeScript Type Error
**Error:** Type mismatch with `user_id` property (expected `string`, got `string | null`)

**Root Cause:**
The database schema allows `user_id` to be NULL for guest bookings, but the TypeScript interface required it to be a string.

**Solution:**
- Updated the `Booking` interface in `src/components/admin/calendar/types.ts`
- Changed `user_id: string` to `user_id: string | null`
- Added comment: "Nullable to support guest bookings"
