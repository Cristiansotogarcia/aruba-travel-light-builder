Project Goal: Develop a robust, production-ready web application for booking management of rentals/services.

Current State & Context:
This project is an ongoing booking management system.

•
Frontend: React with TypeScript, styled using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.

•
Backend: Supabase (authentication, real-time database, file storage).

•
Key Functionalities Implemented/Refined:

•
Customer information editing.

•
Dynamic equipment schedule popups with updated delivery/pickup statuses (Out for Delivery, Delivered, Scheduled, Picked Up).

•
Comprehensive booking status management: pending, confirmed, out_for_delivery, delivered, completed, cancelled, and undeliverable.

•
Functionality for delivery failure reasons and associated "Undo Delivery" / "Reschedule Delivery" features.

•
UI improvements for customer lists (3-column layout, recent booking date, view details button).

•
Refactoring of core components.



•
Database Schema: Existing tables include bookings, booking_items, products, component_visibility, profiles, user_temp_passwords.

•
Visual Design: Refer to the provided screenshots (e.g., Screenshot2025-05-28122146.png for frontend, Screenshot2025-05-28121333.png for backend) for the desired clean, modern aesthetic, layout, and component styling.

Task:
Continue building upon the existing booking management system. Focus on implementing new features, refining current functionalities, and ensuring a polished, production-ready application.

Implementation Approach & Guidelines:

1.
Application Type: This is a booking management SaaS.

2.
User Roles: The following users and their access levels should be configured:

•
Meldrick: Full Access

•
Roxanne: Full Access

•
Angelique Bagheri: Full Access

•
Cristian Soto Garcia: Admin

•
Xerxes Croes: Booking access & Driver (Note: If easier for implementation, create two separate accounts for Xerxes Croes: one for 'Booking access' and one for 'Driver'.)

•
Kenya Donata: Booking

•
Lyrick Pourier: Driver

•
Steven Daza: Driver

•
Vania Dirksz: Driver

•
Jocey Dirksz: Driver
Consider existing roles (Admin, drivers/bookers) and any new roles as features are added.



3.
Essential Features: Implement features that enhance the booking management workflow.

•
Performance optimization.

•
Secure handling of sensitive data.

•
All user-facing text in English.



Technical Architecture:

•
Frontend: React with TypeScript.

•
Styling: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components.

•
Design Details: Primary color: #0066CC, Secondary color: #10B981. Use subtle shadows and rounded corners (rounded-lg). Inter font for UI elements. Consistent spacing. Proper hover and focus states.



•
Backend: Supabase (authentication, real-time database, file storage).

•
Database: Continue using the existing schema. Only add or modify tables/columns as required by new features, without a complete domain shift. Ensure all necessary Supabase buckets are created and correctly linked to relevant tables for file storage (e.g., product images, user profile pictures). Implement proper Row Level Security (RLS) and data retention policies.



•
State Management: React hooks and context.

•
Forms: react-hook-form with zod validation.

•
Icons: lucide-react.

•
Data Visualization: Recharts for any dashboards/reports.

•
Email Notifications: Resend (if new email features are required).

•
Payment Processing: Stripe (if new payment features are required).

Core Features to Implement (Next Iteration - Specific Feature Request from User Needed Here):

User Experience:

•
Smooth animations and transitions.

•
Keyboard navigation support.

•
Intuitive information hierarchy.

•
Content Management: Admins should be able to easily update website content (e.g., product details, descriptions, images) through an intuitive interface, similar to a content management system like WordPress. The system should be ready for product and information uploads as soon as it's deployed.

Development Guidelines:

•
Keep components small and reusable (max 150 lines).

•
Use descriptive variable and function names.

•
Add helpful comments for complex logic.

•
Implement proper error handling.

•
Test each feature thoroughly.

•
Ensure all forms have proper validation.

•
Use environment variables for sensitive data.

Quality Requirements:

•
Zero console errors in production.

•
Optimized and lazy-loaded images.

•
Proper SEO meta tags on public pages (if applicable).

•
Lighthouse score > 90.

•
No hardcoded values; use constants.

•
Consistent naming conventions.

•
Proper TypeScript types.

•
Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA).

Deployment Ready:

•
Include proper error logging.

•
Set up proper CORS policies.

•
Implement rate limiting for API calls.

•
Add analytics (e.g., Google Analytics).

•
Include privacy policy and terms pages.

•
Set up caching strategies.

•
Document environment variables.

•
Implement SSL/TLS encryption.

•
Set up automated backups.

•
Configure webhooks (Stripe, Resend, etc.).

•
Secure admin access.

Build Approach:

1.
Set up project dependencies.

2.
Continue with authentication flow and base layout.

3.
Implement new features incrementally, focusing on the current project's domain.

4.
Refine UI components.

5.
Optimize and test.

Important Note: This prompt is for the existing booking management system. Do NOT attempt to transform it into a "reverse rental platform" or "Huurly.nl". Continue to build upon the current application's purpose and data model.

Start building now, focusing on the next logical feature or a feature specified by the user.
